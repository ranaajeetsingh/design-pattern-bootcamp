Software Design Patterns

Design patterns are used to represent some of the best practices adapted by experienced object-oriented software developers. A design pattern systematically names, motivates, and explains a general design that addresses a recurring design problem in object-oriented systems. It describes the problem, the solution, when to apply the solution, and its consequences. It also gives implementation hints and examples.

Types of Design Patterns
There are mainly three types of design patterns: 

Creational 
These design patterns are all about class instantiation or object creation. These patterns can be further categorized into Class-creational patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done. 

Structural 
These design patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality. 

Behavioral 
Behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realizing these patterns.
